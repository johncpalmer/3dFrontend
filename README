This is a Pong game I made today.


To run the game, navigate to the backendWork director and run:

	npm install

Then run:

	node server.js


Enter the frontendWork directory and run:

	npm install

Then run:

	node index.js



To play, open a browser window and navigate to localhost port 3000.

Once 2 players have joined, the game will begin.
